# Cartoon-face-generation
A Deep convolutional GAN was trained to generate animated faces using the anime dataset. This was a part of PyTorch training by Jovian.ml. The purpose of the model was to generate animated faces and the overall purpose of this project is to gain an understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks.
